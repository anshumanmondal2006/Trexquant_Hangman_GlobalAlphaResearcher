# ðŸ§© Trexquant Hangman Problem - Global Alpha Researcher

## ðŸ§  Approach Summary

This solution uses a regex-based filtering strategy combined with n-gram and bigram frequency models.  
It ranks unguessed letters by their likelihood across matching word candidates, with a vowel density heuristic to avoid early vowel guessing.  
Fallback heuristics use substring matching (0.75, 0.5, 0.33 of word length) to recover from difficult matches.  
When no strong match is found, it defaults to global letter frequency across the training corpus.
